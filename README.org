** mashell
   
   It goes without saying what use is a terminal of without any shell? 
   Well, worry not, here's a shell for our very own terminal ;)

   No, this is not ur usual shell, it does nothing what you're regular *nix shell does (in terms of 
   executing commands, but the concept of shell is same).

** Features
   
   To be added !! :P :D
